ABORT(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                      ABORT(3)

NAME
       abort - cause abnormal process termination

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       void abort(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  abort() first unblocks the SIGABRT signal, and then raises that signal for the calling process (as though
       raise(3) was called).  This results in the abnormal termination of the process unless the  SIGABRT  signal  is
       caught and the signal handler does not return (see longjmp(3)).

       If the abort() function causes process termination, all open streams are closed and flushed.

       If  the SIGABRT signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that returns, the abort() function will still termi‐
       nate the process.  It does this by restoring the default disposition for SIGABRT and then raising  the  signal
       for a second time.

RETURN VALUE
       The abort() function never returns.
