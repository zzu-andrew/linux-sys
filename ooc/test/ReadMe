legalese ---------------------------------------------------------------
While you may use this software package, neither I nor the University
of Osnabrueck can be made responsible for whatever problems you
might cause or encounter.

While you may give away this package and/or software derived with
it, you should not charge for it, you should not claim that ooc is
your work, and I would like to publish my own book about ooc before
you do.

The same restrictions apply to whoever might get this package from
you.

executive summary ------------------------------------------------------
ooc is a technique to do object-oriented programming (classes,
methods, dynamic linkage, simple inheritance, polymorphisms,
persistent objects, method existence testing, message forwarding,
exception handling, etc.) using ANSI-C.

ooc is a preprocessor to simplify the coding task by converting
class descriptions and method implementations into ANSI-C as required
by the technique. You implement the algorithms inside the methods
and the ooc preprocessor produces the boilerplate.

ooc consists of a shell script driving a modular awk script (with
provisions for debugging), a set of reports -- code generation
templates -- interpreted by the script, and the source of a root
class to provide basic functionality.  Everything is designed to
be changed if desired. There are manual pages, lots of examples,
among them a calculator based on curses and X11, and you can ask
me about the book.

ooc as a technique requires an ANSI-C system -- classic C would
necessitate substantial changes. The preprocessor needs a healthy
Bourne-Shell and "new" awk as described in Aho, Weinberger, and
Kernighan's book.

ooc was developed primarily to teach about object-oriented programming
without having to learn a new language. If you see how it is done
in a familiar setting, it is much easier to grasp the concepts and
to know what miracles to expect from the technique and what not.
Conceivably, the preprocessor can be used for production programming
but this was not the original intent. Being able to roll your own
object-oriented coding techniques has its possibilities, however...

technical details ------------------------------------------------------
Most sources should be viewed with tab stops set at 4 characters.

The original system runs on NeXTSTEP 3.2 and older, ESIX (System
V) 4.0.4, and Linux 0.99.pl4-49. You need to review paths in the
script 'ooc/ooc' before running anything. Make sure the first line
of this script points to a Bourne-style shell. Also make sure that
the first line of '*/munch' points to a (new) awk.

The 'ooc' awk-programs have been tested with GNU awk 2.15.2. Previous
versions did not support AWKPATH properly (but this is not essential).

The makefiles could be smarter but they are naive enough for all
systems.  This is a heterogeneous system -- set the environment
variable $A to an architecture-specific name. 'make' in the current
directory will create everything by calling 'make' in the various
subdirectories which is a shell script to create a subdirectory
$A, link files into it, and call 'make' in the subdirectory. Each
'makefile' includes 'makefile.$A' from the current directory, review
'makefile.$A' before you start. Symbolic links are used to accomodate
funny editors such as NeXT Edit.

The following make calls are supported throughout:

	make [all]	create examples
	make test	[make and] run examples
	make clean	remove all but sources (do not combine with others)
	make depend	make dependencies (if makefile.$A supports it)

Make dependencies can be built with the -MM option of the GNU C
compiler.  They are stored in a file 'depend' in each subdirectory.
They should apply to all systems. 'makefile.$A' may include a target
'depend' to recreate 'depend' -- check 'makefile.NeXT' for an
example.

hp700 hp/ux ------------------------------------------------------------
c.07    Object.dc
extern ...
static ...

        draws a warning, but uses static.

c.08
        does not trap type checking
        use _SIGBUS rather than SIGBUS

c.12
        munch botched -- nm does not output static data symbols.
	it looks like we have to generate fake things with ooc or
	we have to produce classes.c on another architecture.  GNU
	nm does not compile, it seems.
sunos 4 ----------------------------------------------------------------
must use gcc, not cc

parse.c
	strerror() does not exist -- replace call simply by "bad
	number" (could make it from sys_nerr, etc.).  strtod() must
	be declared by including math.h.

new.r
        need to include stddef.h to define size_t.

mathlib.c
        strerror() does not exist.

binary.c
        memmove must be replaced by bcopy (arguments reversed).

Symbol.dc
        strerror() does not exist.

Object.dc/retrieve()
        stdlib.h declares char * bsearch(), rather than void *.

Object.dc/Object_geto()
        fprintf knows %p, but fscanf does not. use %x.

cbutton.c
        ex // comments...

Crt.dc
        does not have atexit().
